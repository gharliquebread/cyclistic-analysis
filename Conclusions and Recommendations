# Conclusions and Recommendations
Casual riders differ from member riders in the following ways:

**Trip Duration + Time**
- Longer trips
- Ride frequency increases at a greater rate in the summer months than member rides increase *

**Bike Type**
- Use docked bikes for 14.14% of rides

**Trip Location**
- Strong preference for the station at Streeter Dr & Grand Ave, accounting for 75.96% of casual rides
- The most popular stations also had the highest percentage of docked bike usage
   
   
## Recommendations + Next Steps:
- Determine incentive for annual memberships and docked bikes.
- Collect data on why members take shorter trips and casual riders take shorter trips.
- Collect data on where riders live.
        For example, do tourists make up a large portion of casual riders? 
        Are there shorter membership options that would appeal to tourists withou an annual commitment?)
- Determine if certain days of the week are more popular among casual riders vs members.
        For example, if weekends are significantly more popular for casual riders, consider offering a weekend-oriented membership plan.
- Consider analysing where docked bikes are located and on average how many of each type of bike is located at each station.
- Analyze whether casual riders are more likely than members to ride in summer months.
