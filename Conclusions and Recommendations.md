**Casual riders differ from member riders in the following ways:**

**Trip Duration + Time**
* Longer trips
 * Average casual rider trip duration: 0:13:17.130500621
 * Average member rider trip duration: 0:34:8.299136219
 * Ride frequency increases at a greater rate in the summer months than member rides increase. *

* *Further analysis needed to include data on summer months.*

**Bike Type**
* Use docked bikes for 14.14% of rides

**Trip Location**
* Strong preference for the station at Streeter Dr & Grand Ave, accounting for 75.96% of casual rides
* The most popular stations also had the highest percentage of docked bike usage
   
   
## Recommendations + Next Steps:
* Determine incentive for annual memberships and docked bikes.
* Collect data on why members take shorter trips and casual riders take longer trips.
* Collect data on where riders live.
        For example, do tourists make up a large portion of casual riders? 
        Are there shorter membership options that would appeal to tourists withou an annual commitment?)
* Determine if certain days of the week are more popular among casual riders vs members.
        For example, if weekends are significantly more popular for casual riders, consider offering a weekend-oriented membership plan.
* Consider analysing where docked bikes are located and on average how many of each type of bike is located at each station.
* Analyze whether casual riders are more likely than members to ride in summer months.
